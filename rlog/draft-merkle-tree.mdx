In this post, we introduce a crucial data structure used throughout web3.

## Introduction

A large amount of data is swapped between users on a blockchain in the form of transactions.
Over the entire lifespan of a blockchain,
the storage space required to maintain a copy of every transaction becomes untenable for most users.
However, the integrity of a blockchain relies on a large pool of users being able to validate the blockchain's history to its present state.
The data representing the blockchain's state is compressed.
This compression addresses the issue of scale that would greatly restrict the pool of users.

Data compression alone is not the end goal.
As mentioned, it is essential for users to beable to validate the blockchain's history.
This problem was solved by Bitcoin by the use of Merkle trees.
Merkle trees were first by Ralph Merkle in his dissertation (TODO-citation).
Merkle trees is a data structure that compresses a digest of data to a constant size while still providing a method for proving membership of elements of the digest.

## Tree structure

### Binary Trees

A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children.
Binary trees are commonly used in practice.

### Verkle Trees
A proof of membership grows in length as the Merkle tree grows.
The most obvious approach to remedy this scalability issue is to use Merkle trees where each node has more than 2 children.
However, as we saw earlier, this does not fix the issue.
An alternate approach is to use a different data structure: [Verkle trees](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2018/Kuszmaul.pdf).
A Verkle tree replaces hash functions with polynomial commitments.
We will explore Verkle trees is a future Vac 101 edition.
